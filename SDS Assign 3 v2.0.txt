    </p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="archstrategies">
    <h2>6. Architectural Strategies</h2>
    <h3>6.1. System Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      The system is architected as a modular, multi-layered web application. Its primary components include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User Interface Layer:</strong> Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver an interactive, responsive full-page map with easy navigation and engaging UI elements.</li>
      <li><strong>Mapping Engine:</strong> Powered by the ArcGIS JavaScript API to render dynamic maps, markers, popups, and polyline overlays with high performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Management:</strong> Manages JSON feeds that provide comprehensive details about attractions, trails, and media, ensuring data consistency and real-time updates when possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Enhancement Modules:</strong> Initially planned modules for Turf.js spatial analysis and dynamic media integration are recorded here—even though they were ultimately abandoned due to time constraints.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>6.2. Subsystem Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      The system is further divided into these key subsystems:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bookmark and Expand Widgets:</strong> Deliver interactive lists of attractions and trails with detailed, user-friendly views.</li>
      <li><strong>GraphicsLayer Management:</strong> Efficiently renders vector graphics (markers, polylines) and dynamically updates them based on user interactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Planned Turf.js Module:</strong> Intended for advanced spatial analysis (buffering, clustering, distance calculations) but ultimately scrapped due to time limitations.</li>
      <li><strong>Planned Media Handling Module:</strong> Designed to enable dynamic, high-resolution image integration, which was also set aside because of insufficient time to fully implement.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  
  <section id="policies">
    <h2>7. Policies and Tactics</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Coding Conventions:</strong>  
      All code is written following modern best practices in JavaScript and CSS, with clear naming conventions and thorough inline documentation to ensure ease of maintenance.
      <br><strong>Error Handling:</strong>  
      Robust error handling is employed throughout, with fallback mechanisms such as default placeholder images and informative error messages when external resources fail.
      <br><strong>Performance:</strong>  
      Techniques such as efficient GraphicsLayer usage, event throttling, asynchronous loading, and lazy-loading are used to ensure the application remains fast and responsive.
      <br><strong>Testing:</strong>  
      Comprehensive testing—including unit, integration, and user acceptance tests—ensures that both successfully implemented features and attempted features (that ultimately failed) are thoroughly evaluated and documented.

    <h2>8. Detailed System Design</h2>
    
    <h3>8.1. Detailed Component Design</h3>
    
    <h4>8.1.1. Map and UI Initialization</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Classification:</strong> Core mapping module.
      <br><strong>Definition:</strong> Initializes the ArcGIS map within the <code>&lt;div id="viewDiv"&gt;</code> container, sets the initial view (center: [-159.526, 22.096], zoom: 11), and loads essential UI widgets (BasemapToggle, ScaleBar, Search, Home).
      <br><strong>Responsibilities:</strong>
      <br>– Guarantee responsive display and correct centering.
      <br>– Seamlessly integrate UI widgets with robust error handling and asynchronous resource management.
      <br><strong>Implementation:</strong>  
      Employs the ArcGIS API’s MapView and widget components, ensuring a consistent, visually appealing interface tailored for the tourism industry.
    </p>
    
    <h4>8.1.2. Graphics and Popup Handling</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Classification:</strong> UI graphics module.
      <br><strong>Definition:</strong> Renders dynamic markers for attractions and polylines for trails via multiple GraphicsLayers.
      <br><strong>Responsibilities:</strong>
      <br>– Dynamically compute marker sizes, colors, and outlines based on the type of attraction.
      <br>– Configure popup templates to provide detailed attraction information (name, description, coordinates, images, and navigation details) in an engaging format.
      <br>– Implement fallback strategies for missing data.
      <br><strong>Processing:</strong>  
      Uses helper functions such as <code>getSymbolColor()</code> and <code>getMarkerSize()</code> to determine styling, integrating image elements within popups for a rich user experience.
    </p>
    
    <h4>8.1.3. Trails and Polyline Overlays</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Classification:</strong> Mapping subsystem.
      <br><strong>Definition:</strong> Renders hiking trails as dashed polylines on the map.
      <br><strong>Responsibilities:</strong>
      <br>– Process trail data arrays (including coordinates, distances, and difficulty levels).
      <br>– Render trails with a consistent dashed line style for clarity and visual distinction.
      <br><strong>Processing:</strong>  
      Converts trail data into polyline graphics using the ArcGIS API, ensuring trails are clearly delineated for travelers and tourism managers.
    </p>
    
    <h4>8.1.4. Turf.js Spatial Analysis Module (Failed)</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Classification:</strong> Enhancement module (attempted).
      <br><strong>Definition:</strong> Designed to integrate Turf.js for advanced spatial analysis—including distance measurement, buffering, and clustering of attractions.
      <br><strong>Responsibilities (Planned):</strong>
      <br>– Calculate precise distances between attractions.
      <br>– Generate buffers around key points of interest.
      <br>– Cluster nearby attractions to provide enhanced geographic insights.
      <br><strong>Processing (Planned):</strong>  
      Intended to import Turf.js functions to process GeoJSON data from existing GraphicsLayers and overlay analysis results on the map.
      <br><strong>Outcome and Reasoning:</strong>  
      Despite detailed plans and robust design, this module was not implemented because I simply don't have the friggin time anymore. The extensive development and testing required exceeded the available project timeline.
    </p>
    
    <h4>8.1.5. Media Integration for Location Images (Failed)</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Classification:</strong> UI enhancement module (attempted).
      <br><strong>Definition:</strong> Aimed to dynamically load high-resolution images for each attraction to enhance visual appeal.
      <br><strong>Responsibilities (Planned):</strong>
      <br>– Dynamically load and display high-quality images.
      <br>– Use responsive CSS media queries to adapt images to various device sizes.
      <br>– Provide fallback placeholder images when an image URL is missing.
      <br><strong>Processing (Planned):</strong>  
      Planned to extend popup templates and bookmark widgets with <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements, leveraging lazy-loading and caching techniques.
      <br><strong>Outcome and Reasoning:</strong>  
      This feature was also shelved due to time constraints—again, I don't have the friggin time anymore to perfect this integration. The complexity and required performance optimizations proved too resource-intensive for the current schedule.
    </p>
    
    <h3>8.2. Failed Features and Lessons Learned</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to the Turf.js and dynamic image modules described above, several other advanced features were attempted but ultimately not integrated:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>GeoRouting Integration via Mapbox:</strong>  
        Advanced routing features using Mapbox were explored, but performance issues and compatibility conflicts with the ArcGIS API led to its abandonment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Real-Time Weather Overlay:</strong>  
        Although a real-time weather overlay was prototyped, inconsistent API responses and rate-limit challenges made the feature unreliable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Social Media Feed Integration:</strong>  
        Attempted integration of live social media feeds (e.g., Instagram) was hindered by privacy restrictions and API limitations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Advanced Clustering with External Libraries:</strong>  
        External clustering algorithms were evaluated to enhance attraction grouping, but it was determined that Turf.js (if implemented) would suffice, and additional libraries were not used.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Offline Caching of Map Data:</strong>  
        An offline caching mechanism for map tiles and attraction data was prototyped, but technical constraints and storage limitations rendered the approach unfeasible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dynamic Trail Difficulty Updates:</strong>  
        Real-time updates of trail difficulty using sensor data were explored; however, the complexity of integration and accuracy concerns led to its removal.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each failed feature is documented here to capture the lessons learned and to guide future improvements. The overriding reason for the exclusion of these advanced features remains a severe shortage of development time.
