  </section>
  
  <section id="archstrategies">
    <h2>6. Architectural Strategies</h2>
    <h3>6.1. System Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      The system is architected as a modular, multi-layered web application with these primary components:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User Interface Layer:</strong> Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this layer delivers an engaging, responsive full-page map with intuitive navigation and interactive UI elements.</li>
      <li><strong>Mapping Engine:</strong> Powered by the ArcGIS JavaScript API, it dynamically renders maps, markers, popups, and polyline overlays with high efficiency.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Management:</strong> Handles JSON feeds that supply detailed information about attractions, trails, and media, ensuring data integrity and up-to-date content.</li>
      <li><strong>Enhancement Modules:</strong> Originally planned modules for Turf.js spatial analysis and dynamic image integration are thoroughly documented—even though they were abandoned due to code issues and time constraints.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>6.2. Subsystem Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      The system is further divided into these subsystems:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bookmark and Expand Widgets:</strong> Provide interactive lists of attractions and trails, complete with expandable detailed views.</li>
      <li><strong>GraphicsLayer Management:</strong> Efficiently renders vector graphics (markers, polylines) and dynamically updates them based on user interactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Planned Turf.js Module:</strong> Intended for advanced spatial analysis (buffering, clustering, distance calculations) but ultimately abandoned due to technical challenges and insufficient time.</li>
      <li><strong>Planned Media Handling Module:</strong> Designed for dynamic, high-resolution image integration with responsive design; this module remains as future work due to time constraints.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  
  <section id="policies">

    <h2>8. Detailed System Design</h2>
    
    <h3>8.1. Detailed Component Design</h3>
    
    <h4>8.1.1. Map and UI Initialization</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Classification:</strong> Core mapping module.
      <br><strong>Definition:</strong> Initializes the ArcGIS map within the <code>&lt;div id="viewDiv"&gt;</code> container, sets the initial view (center: [-159.526, 22.096], zoom: 11), and loads essential UI widgets (BasemapToggle, ScaleBar, Search, Home).
      <br><strong>Responsibilities:</strong>
      <br>– Ensure the map is responsive and accurately centered.
      <br>– Seamlessly integrate UI widgets with robust error handling and asynchronous resource management.
      <br><strong>Implementation:</strong>  
      Utilizes the ArcGIS API’s MapView and widget components, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that caters to tourism professionals.
    </p>
    
    <h4>8.1.2. Graphics and Popup Handling</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Classification:</strong> UI graphics module.
      <br><strong>Definition:</strong> Renders dynamic markers for attractions and polylines for trails using multiple GraphicsLayers.
      <br><strong>Responsibilities:</strong>
      <br>– Compute marker sizes, colors, and outlines dynamically based on the type of attraction.
      <br>– Configure popup templates to present detailed attraction information, including names, descriptions, coordinates, and images.
      <br>– Provide fallback strategies for missing data.
      <br><strong>Processing:</strong>  
      Employs helper functions like <code>getSymbolColor()</code> and <code>getMarkerSize()</code> to determine styling, integrating image elements within popups for a rich, engaging experience.
    </p>
    
    <h4>8.1.3. Trails and Polyline Overlays</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Classification:</strong> Mapping subsystem.
      <br><strong>Definition:</strong> Renders hiking trails as dashed polylines on the interactive map.
      <br><strong>Responsibilities:</strong>
      <br>– Process trail data (coordinates, distances, difficulty ratings).
      <br>– Render trails with a consistent dashed line style for clear visual distinction.
      <br><strong>Processing:</strong>  
      Converts trail data arrays into polyline graphics using the ArcGIS API, ensuring that each trail is clearly visible and accessible for both travelers and tourism managers.
    </p>
    
    <h4>8.1.4. Turf.js Spatial Analysis Module (Failed)</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Classification:</strong> Enhancement module (attempted).
      <br><strong>Definition:</strong> This module was designed to integrate Turf.js for advanced spatial analysis—including distance measurement, buffering, and clustering of attractions.
      <br><strong>Responsibilities (Planned):</strong>
      <br>– Calculate precise distances between attractions.
      <br>– Generate buffers around points of interest.
      <br>– Cluster nearby attractions for enhanced geographic insights.
      <br><strong>Processing (Planned):</strong>  
      Intended to import Turf.js functions to process GeoJSON data from existing GraphicsLayers and dynamically overlay the analysis results.
      <br><strong>Outcome and Reasoning:</strong>  
      Despite a robust design, this module was abandoned due to persistent code issues and time constraints. Quite frankly, I don't have the friggin time anymore to perfect this integration.
    </p>
    
    <h4>8.1.5. Media Integration for Location Images (Failed)</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Classification:</strong> UI enhancement module (attempted).
      <br><strong>Definition:</strong> Aimed to enhance the visual appeal by dynamically loading high-resolution images for each attraction, including other attractions and trails.
      <br><strong>Responsibilities (Planned):</strong>
      <br>– Dynamically load and display high-quality images for each point of interest.
      <br>– Use responsive CSS media queries to ensure images adapt to various device sizes.
      <br>– Provide fallback placeholder images when an image URL is missing.
      <br><strong>Processing (Planned):</strong>  
      Planned to extend popup templates and bookmark widgets with <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements, leveraging lazy-loading and caching strategies.
      <br><strong>Outcome and Reasoning:</strong>  
      This feature, too, was shelved due to time constraints—again, I don't have the friggin time anymore to fully integrate and optimize this functionality.
    </p>
    
    <h3>8.2. Failed Features and Lessons Learned</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to the Turf.js and media integration modules described above, several other advanced features were attempted but ultimately not implemented:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>GeoRouting Integration via Mapbox:</strong>  
        Advanced routing was explored using Mapbox; however, performance issues and compatibility conflicts with the ArcGIS API led to its abandonment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Real-Time Weather Overlay:</strong>  
        Although prototyped, real-time weather data integration was hindered by inconsistent API responses and rate-limit challenges.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Social Media Feed Integration:</strong>  
        Live social media feeds (e.g., Instagram) were considered to enhance attraction data, but privacy restrictions and API limitations prevented a robust implementation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Advanced Clustering with External Libraries:</strong>  
        Alternative clustering algorithms were evaluated, but it was determined that Turf.js (if implemented) would have been sufficient; thus, external libraries were not integrated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Offline Caching of Map Data:</strong>  
        An offline caching mechanism for map tiles and attraction data was prototyped, but technical constraints and device storage limitations rendered this approach unfeasible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dynamic Trail Difficulty Updates:</strong>  
        Real-time trail difficulty updates using sensor data were explored but ultimately removed due to the complexity and accuracy challenges.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each failed feature is documented here with detailed reasoning to capture the lessons learned and to guide future development. The overriding reason for many of these advanced features being left unimplemented was simply a lack of time.
